# Solving Linear problems using the Simplex Method/Big M Method
This project solves linear programming problems to optimality as taught to us by **Prof. Assad El Nidani** in the Quantitative Business Analysis course as part of the MBA program.
I want to thank him personally for tolerating my endless questions and thoroughly answering them.
## Disclaimer
This code is not a clean code, it's just something that I threw together in my spare time because I was bored and curious :D and was tested on very limited cases.
